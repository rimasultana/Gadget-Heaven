## React Fundamental Concepts Used in the Project
This project utilizes the following React fundamental concepts:

1. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: The syntax used to describe the UI components.
2. **Components**: Functional and Class components used to structure the app.
3. **Props**: Passed from parent to child components to manage data flow.
4. **State**: Used for managing dynamic data inside components.
5. **Event Handling**: Handling user inputs through events such as `onClick`, `onChange`, etc.
6. **Hooks**:
   - `useState`: To manage state in functional components.
   - `useEffect`: To handle side effects such as data fetching or lifecycle events.
7. **Context API**: Used for state management and sharing data across components without prop drilling.
8. **React Router**: To navigate between different views or pages within the app.
9. **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying different UI elements based on conditions.
10. **Forms and Validation**: Handling form input and validations.

## Data Handling and Management
For managing and handling data, the following methods have been used:

- **Context API**: To handle global state management and share data across various components.
